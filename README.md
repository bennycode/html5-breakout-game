HTML5 Breakout game
===================

Preamble:
The initial code of this HTML5 Breakout game comes from a short break hack and will be refactored step by step. The refactoring is part of a book on JavaScript refactoring patterns from Benny Neugebauer.

How to play the game:
In the game, a layer of bricks lines the top of the screen. The player has a paddle and a ball which jumps over the screen. When a brick is hit, the ball bounces away and the brick is destroyed. The goal is to destroy all the bricks on the field.

Controls:
You can move the paddle by clicking with the mouse in the canvas and then move the mouse.
